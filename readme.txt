The ETL pipeline code is inserting the data again and again instead of re-writing the existing rows. This maybe a bug.
column 14: 'num' is the target variable. It can range from 0 to 4.



Model selection:
Selecting the right machine learning model for the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset (or any dataset) involves a combination of understanding the problem you're trying to solve, the nature of the data, and the model's capabilities. Here's a guide to help you select an appropriate machine learning model for predicting heart disease (`num` column in the Cleveland dataset).

### 1. **Understand the Problem**
   - The `num` column in the Cleveland dataset represents the presence and severity of heart disease in a person, which can be interpreted as a **classification problem**.
   - If you're predicting whether or not someone has heart disease (binary classification: `num == 0` or `num > 0`), this is a **binary classification** problem.
   - If you're predicting the exact severity (`num` values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), this is a **multiclass classification** problem.

### 2. **Analyze the Features**
   - The dataset contains numeric and categorical features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
   - These features need to be appropriately preprocessed (e.g., scaling, encoding) before applying machine learning algorithms.

### 3. **Preprocessing Steps**
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Ensure any missing or null values are imputed or removed.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Many algorithms (especially those based on distance metrics) perform better when features are scaled. You might use techniques like **Min-Max scaling** or **Standardization** (z-score normalization).
   - **Categorical Variables**: Encode categorical variables (like `sex` or `cp`) using methods like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**.

### 4. **Model Selection Based on the Type of Classification**
   Based on the nature of the problem (classification), here are a few model options:

#### 4.1 **Logistic Regression (Binary or Multiclass)**
   - **Use Case**: Good for simpler, interpretable models. Can be used for both binary and multiclass classification problems.
   - **Pros**: Fast, interpretable, and works well for linearly separable problems.
   - **Cons**: Not ideal for complex relationships or nonlinear boundaries.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
   ```

#### 4.2 **Decision Trees**
   - **Use Case**: Can handle both binary and multiclass classification. Suitable when you need a model that is easy to interpret.
   - **Pros**: Interpretable, works well with categorical and continuous features, handles non-linearities well.
   - **Cons**: Can overfit, especially with many features or deep trees.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
   ```

#### 4.3 **Random Forest**
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for both binary and multiclass classification. It’s a powerful ensemble method built from multiple decision trees.
   - **Pros**: Robust, handles overfitting better than individual decision trees, handles both categorical and continuous features well.
   - **Cons**: Can be computationally expensive.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
   ```

#### 4.4 **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - **Use Case**: Works well for both binary and multiclass classification, especially when there is a clear margin of separation.
   - **Pros**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and for non-linear decision boundaries (when using kernels).
   - **Cons**: Can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   model = SVC(kernel='rbf')
   ```

#### 4.5 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - **Use Case**: Works well for both binary and multiclass classification problems. Non-parametric, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
   - **Pros**: Simple, intuitive, and works well for problems where similar data points are close in feature space.
   - **Cons**: Computationally expensive for large datasets and sensitive to the choice of distance metric and number of neighbors.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
   model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
   ```

#### 4.6 **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) / XGBoost / LightGBM**
   - **Use Case**: These are powerful ensemble models that can perform very well for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.
   - **Pros**: High performance, works well with imbalanced datasets, can handle both numerical and categorical data.
   - **Cons**: Can be computationally expensive and more complex to tune.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
   model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)
   ```

#### 4.7 **Neural Networks (Deep Learning)**
   - **Use Case**: Can be used if you have large datasets with complex relationships, but may be overkill for simpler datasets.
   - **Pros**: High capacity for learning complex relationships and can improve with more data.
   - **Cons**: Requires more data, computational resources, and tuning.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
   model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(64, 32), max_iter=500)
   ```

### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   Depending on your classification type (binary or multiclass), you can use these metrics to evaluate the model’s performance:
   - **Accuracy**: How many predictions are correct.
   - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Helps to understand the misclassification.
   - **ROC-AUC**: For binary classification problems.

### 6. **Model Tuning**
   Once you've chosen a model, it’s important to fine-tune it to achieve the best performance:
   - Use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
   - Cross-validation to ensure generalizability and avoid overfitting.

### Example Model Training:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop(columns=['num'])  # Features
y = df['num']  # Target

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model (Random Forest as an example)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Final Thoughts:
- If you're new to machine learning, **Random Forest** or **Logistic Regression** is a good starting point as they provide strong performance without heavy tuning.
- For more complex patterns, you can experiment with **Gradient Boosting** (like XGBoost or LightGBM) or **Neural Networks** if you have the computational power and data.

By following these steps, you should be able to select, train, and evaluate a model for predicting heart disease from the Cleveland dataset.
